# StkAg

A proof of concept for API Gateway.

`git clone https://github.com/AndreasLoukakis/stk-ag-poc.git`

`npm install`

`ng serve`

The api should listen to *https://localhost:44319/*

There is also a dependency on a modified version of `ng-openapi-gen` which should be available on internal registry at some point, serve and build commands should first generate all open api related constructs from scratch.
